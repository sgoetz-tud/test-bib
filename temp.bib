	abstract = {The systematic analysis of related work is an important part of every research project. Surprisingly, especially in computer science, this activity is typically performed manually. Whilst in other disciplines fully automated analysis approaches exist, the lack of a reasonably complete, queryable and free-to-use literature catalog for computer science requires computer scientists to manually retrieve, merge and analyze literature from different catalogs. Although manual literature retrieval is enforced by the current main publishers, tool support to merge and cleanse literature found in different catalogs as well as to analyze the results is possible and needed. The systematic literature review toolkit, an Eclipse Rich Client Platform application leveraging the Eclipse Modeling Framework, aims to provide this support. Currently, four main features are supported: simple literature filtering, design of a taxonomy, classification of literature and analysis of the classification by generated diagrams. The tool is available online: https://github.com/sebastiangoetz/slr-toolkit},
